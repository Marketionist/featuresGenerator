# featuresGenerator
Test version of chrome features generator plugin.

## Including
* chrome plugin creation

## Will include (planning before 0.1 version released)
* read locators from node.js module
* replace some locators parts to correct (ex. change some unique ids to correct one)
* basic onclick steps generating
* onlick locators re-highlighting (including page loading completed)
* locators popups including their names
