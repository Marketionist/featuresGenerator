# featuresGenerator
Test version of chrome features generator plugin.

## Including
* chrome plugin creation
* multiple locators, found by xpath, highlighting
* basic onclick steps generating
* locators popups including their names
* plugin panel

## Will include (planning before 0.1 version released)

* replace some locators parts to correct (ex. change some unique ids to correct one)
* onlick locators re-highlighting (including page loading completed)
* ability to add feature steps/actions manually

## Plans for future:
* start/stop record button
